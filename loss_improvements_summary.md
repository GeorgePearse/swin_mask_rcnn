# Loss Improvements Summary

## Changes Made to Reduce Initial Loss

### 1. Weight Initialization (Added to SwinTransformer)
- Added proper weight initialization with truncated normal (std=0.02) for Linear layers
- Added constant initialization (1.0, 0.0) for LayerNorm layers  
- Added Kaiming normal initialization for Conv2d layers

### 2. Architecture Parameters (Updated to match MMDetection)
- Changed drop_path_rate from 0.2 to 0.1
- Verified correct depths [2, 2, 18, 2] for Swin-S
- Verified correct num_heads [3, 6, 12, 24] for Swin-S

### 3. Loss Normalization (Fixed in RPN)
- Changed from `.sum()` to `.mean()` for RPN classification loss
- Changed from `.sum()` to `.mean()` for RPN bbox regression loss
- ROI head losses already use mean-based losses (F.cross_entropy, etc.)

### 4. Loss Weighting (Added to train.py)
- Added explicit loss weights configuration
- Currently all weights set to 1.0 (can be tuned later)

## Expected Initial Loss Ranges (from MMDetection)
- RPN Cls Loss: ~0.7 (binary cross-entropy)
- RPN Bbox Loss: ~1-3
- ROI Cls Loss: ~3-4 (depends on num_classes)  
- ROI Bbox Loss: ~1-2
- ROI Mask Loss: ~0.7
- Total Loss: ~6-10

## Next Steps
1. Run the check_initial_loss.py script to verify improvements
2. Compare with pretrained weights initialization
3. Adjust loss weights if needed
4. Check gradient flow and norm
